      <p>This project seeks to develop a smart dog collar prototype that detects seizures in dogs. 
        Leveraging this accelerometer and gyroscope data, machine learning models can be trained and deployed to detect seizures in real-time.  The collar will be connected to an app for the owner so they can monitor their dogs behaviours and receive notifications of seizures in real-time. This allows instant action to be taken to mitigate the negative effects of a seizure. 
        Current goal is to design and build a dozen devices to be used in a formal research study.

        Mabel (b. 2013)
          - rescue ¾ Greyhound, ¼ Irish Wolfhound
          - developed epilepsy in 2017
          - “cluster seizure” for ~12 hours
          - vets could not stop it
          - brain temperature reached 109°F 
          - suffered brain damage (“hard drive wipe”)
          - slowly relearned to stand, walk, bathroom, etc. 
          - she enjoys a great life as of 2022
          - If I had had this proposed technology, 
          - I could have intervened earlier and avoid the worst of this.
